          This tool was developed by local authority data analysts, supported by
          technical expertise from our friends at Social Finance. It will let
          you perform the same kinds of data validation as the DfEâ€™s SSDA903
          statutory data submission tool. You can run this tool at any time,
          using your year-to-date extract of SSDA903 data. We recommend a
